Learning Outcomes:
• Model Implementation: We successfully learned to apply Logistic
Regression and Naive Bayes models for credit card fraud detection.
• Data Preprocessing Skills: We displayed proficiency in data preprocessing techniques, including feature normalisation using StandardScaler method.
• Performance Evaluation: We leant to evaluate model accuracy through confusion matrices, providing insights into prediction quality.
• Cross-Validation Understanding: We understood that cross-validation such as a robust method for assessing model performance, gaining insights into generalisation capabilities are very essential in a Machine Learning project.
• Foundation for Advanced Techniques: We established a base foundation for more sophisticated fraud detection techniques, including handling imbalanced datasets and exploring advanced algorithms to help achieve high accuracy in fraud detection.
